# EnumJava

Overview:
Following along a YouTube video I did an example of an enum. 
An enum is a set of predefined values that do not change. 
They are a group of constants, such as day of the weeks and
the months of the year. 
This project is to see if the planet is habitable.

HOW:

Create an enum class and label it as planets.
The planets should have values and an added integer variable.
Build a constructor. 
Create an object without using the "new" keyword.
Make a static method and a switch class. 
If the case is earth, make a println as habitable and its number.
Leaving the other constants in the default and non-habitable with 
its corresponding number. 
Call the method in the main class. 

***Its good practice to have the constant in uppercase.
